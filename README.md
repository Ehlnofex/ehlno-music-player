# ehlno-music-player

A web music platform. Listen to the music you uploaded.

---

This is a basic project using PHP and MongoDB for the back-end.
On the front-end there is use of JavaScript and a bit of jQuery.

This project uses:

+ [Twitter Bootsrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for global rendering
+ [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for the icons
+ [DataTables](http://www.datatables.net/) for the song table pagination and search
+ [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) for the song saving
+ [PHP](http://php.net/) for html generation and file processing

## Installation

Make sure you have the following installed on your server and running:
+ PHP > 5.5
+ MongoDB > 2.6

You may have to configure your `php.ini` file in order to upload bigger files
(see (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2184513/php-change-the-maximum-upload-file-size)).


Clone or download and extract the repo into your website (e.g. `www/music`).

Visit your website (where the `index.php` is located) and start using the player.

### Notice

I can't say this is a bullet proof project, there are lots of bugs around and security is **absolutely not checked**.
It's just a mockup project.

Please act carefully when using it. I know it sounds suspissious...
